# Project Description

Rental Hunters is a Python-based function library created to analyze Rental Hunters is a student-focused housing analysis system that helps University of Maryland students find the best rental options near campus.
The system evaluates properties based on price fairness, commute convenience, safety, lease flexibility, and access to nearby amenities — producing an overall “Best Value Score” for each rental.

# Domain Focus and Problem Statement

Domain: Off-Campus Student Housing Analysis

Problem: UMD students often struggle to find rentals that balance affordability, safety, and convenience.

Solution: This library provides Python functions that calculate rental scores using price comparisons, commute times, nearby amenities, and safety metrics. These will later be integrated into a complete scoring system and user interface.
