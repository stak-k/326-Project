#AI Collaboration
### Bryan 11/2: 
We had to make sure we got all of the core classes we needed and what would be the most logical to start first. I gave Chat GPT what the classes we wanted to do and the main input form for the rental property users will enter. Serra started working on formatter.py and I will begin checking the work she did on that file and add anything I see that will fit. Then I will start working on the rental_property.py which will be the foundation for handling the input of the property. I will then start working on the scoring class, commute class, and listing manager class. After I get the core work done Serra and Nick will go through it and add functions that fit and make sure they understand every aspect of the classes implemented.


I got stuck on rental_property.py because I need validator to be complete so I will start building that out now

### Serra  
Throughout the Rental Hunters project, I used AI tools such as ChatGPT as a learning assistant and problem-solving support, not as a replacement for my own work. AI helped me understand concepts, troubleshoot problems, and improve how I structured and tested my code across Projects 1, 2, 3, and 4.

In the earlier projects, I mainly used AI to clarify validation and formatting logic, especially when handling user inputs like addresses, rent values, ZIP codes, and error conditions. AI explanations helped me understand why certain checks were necessary and how to handle edge cases more cleanly, but I implemented and tested all logic myself.

One specific area where AI was helpful was during demo and testing script development. While testing many functions, I realized that writing separate try/except blocks for each case was inefficient and limited how many scenarios I could test. With AI guidance, I created a small helper function to standardize testing:
``` bash
def run_test(func_name, *args):
    try:
        result = func_name(*args)
        print(f"✅ {func_name.__name__}{args} → {result}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ {func_name.__name__}{args} → {type(e).__name__}: {e}")
```

This approach allowed me to test multiple valid and invalid inputs consistently and helped me better understand structured testing practices.

In Project 3, when we transitioned to object-oriented programming, I used AI to help me reason through class responsibilities and method behavior. I worked on validation logic inside classes, property updates, and formatting outputs. AI helped me think through how setters, error handling, and object state should behave, but I always tested changes locally to make sure I fully understood them. 

In Project 4, I forced AI more for system-level thinking rather than individual functions. This included understanding CSV persistence, how to safely load and validate imported data, how to use context managers (with statements), and how to design unit, integration, and system tests using unittest. AI helped me confirm whether my tests actually represented real workflows, such as saving data, loading it in a new session, and rejecting corrupted files.

Overall, AI acted as a guided learning tool, similar to a tutor or documentation assistant. It helped me grow more confident in Python, testing, validation, and system integration while keeping full responsibility for the final implementation. This collaboration improved both my technical skills and my ability to think critically about code design and testing practices.

### Nick 

	Throughout the duration of this project, I used AI in a number of different ways. During every project, I mostly filled in gaps that needed to be filled. So if I needed to add in functions where their primary functions were outlined, I did it, if I needed to naked a new function up, I did it. There was also a lot of annotation and explanation involved in this process. That is largely where I used AI. Considering how my work was so mismatched and jumbled in with my partners, it is difficult to tell exactly where I used AI and where I didn’t. But I can recall using AI to write a number of explanations and design a number of functions. Looking through my commits, the last one I did was going through and adding docstrings to a number of functions within the rental_type and type_score methods. This was done using both AI and myself.
